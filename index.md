## Hi. I am Zhenya

### my story:

I'm born and grows in the garden on Earth. 

It's an amazing playce. With comfortable temperature,

Between mountains and Sea, clean ecology, food is live health,

Forests of junipper and cedar, 


Between cultured and kind common people, 

whose parks, attitude to nature, 

Attitude to guests, to themselves, 

as a spiritual art, 



And we always so happy to other kind people

We are just creatures

We are do'nt understand Universe as well

We are "little" Giants.



And if each in humanity, find self kind and reasonable way

Our great common future,

Rise by souls enpowered, turning away from hell

Mutual understanding - most important science.
